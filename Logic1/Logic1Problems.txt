1. public boolean cigarParty(int cigars, boolean isWeekend) ->

    When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. 
    A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. 
    Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars.
    Return true if the party with the given values is successful, or false otherwise.


        cigarParty(30, false) → false
        cigarParty(50, false) → true
        cigarParty(70, true) → true

2. public int caughtSpeeding(int speed, boolean isBirthday) ->

    You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. 
    Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket.
     If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. 
     If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.


        if (speed <= 60) return 0;
        else if (speed >= 61 && speed <= 90) return 1;
        else if (speed >= 81) return 2;

        caughtSpeeding(60, false) → 0
        caughtSpeeding(65, false) → 1
        caughtSpeeding(65, true) → 0








3. public boolean love6(int a, int b) -> 
    The number 6 is a truly great number. Given two int values, a and b, 
    return true if either one is 6. Or if their sum or difference is 6. 
    Note: the function Math.abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.


        love6(6, 4) → true
        love6(4, 5) → false
        love6(1, 5) → true


4. public boolean more20(int n) ->
    
    Return true if the given non-negative number is 1 or 2 more than a multiple of 20. See also: Introduction to Mod

        more20(20) → false
        more20(21) → true
        more20(22) → true

7. public boolean twoAsOne(int a, int b, int c) ->
    Given three ints, a b c, return true if it is possible to add two of the ints to get the third.
        twoAsOne(1, 2, 3) → true
        twoAsOne(3, 1, 2) → true
        twoAsOne(3, 2, 2) → false

2. public int sortaSum(int a, int b) ->

    Given 2 ints, a and b, return their sum. However, sums in the range 10..19 inclusive, are forbidden, so in that case just return 20.


        sortaSum(3, 4) → 7
        sortaSum(9, 4) → 20
        sortaSum(10, 11) → 21

3. public boolean in1To10(int n, boolean outsideMode) ->

    Given a number n, return true if n is in the range 1..10, inclusive. 
    Unless outsideMode is true, in which case return true if the number is less or equal to 1, or greater or equal to 10.


        in1To10(5, false) → true
        in1To10(11, false) → false
        in1To10(11, true) → true

4. public boolean old35(int n) ->

    Return true if the given non-negative number is a multiple of 3 or 5, but not both.
    Use the % "mod" operator -- see Introduction to Mod

        old35(3) → true
        old35(10) → true
        old35(15) → false


5. public int teenSum(int a, int b) ->

    Given 2 ints, a and b, return their sum. However, "teen" values in the range 13..19 inclusive, are extra lucky. 
    So if either value is a teen, just return 19.


        teenSum(3, 4) → 7
        teenSum(10, 13) → 19
        teenSum(13, 2) → 19


6. public String fizzString(String str) ->

    Given a string str, if the string starts with "f" return "Fizz". 
    If the string ends with "b" return "Buzz". If both the "f" and "b" conditions are true, 
    return "FizzBuzz". In all other cases, return the string unchanged. (See also: FizzBuzz Code)


    fizzString("fig") → "Fizz"
    fizzString("dib") → "Buzz"
    fizzString("fib") → "FizzBuzz"


7. public boolean inOrder(int a, int b, int c, boolean bOk) ->
    Given three ints, a b c, return true if b is greater than a, and c is greater than b. 
    However, with the exception that if "bOk" is true, b does not need to be greater than a.

        inOrder(1, 2, 4, false) → true
        inOrder(1, 2, 1, false) → false
        inOrder(1, 1, 2, true) → true
