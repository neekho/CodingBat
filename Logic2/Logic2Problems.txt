4. public int loneSum(int a, int b, int c) ->

    Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if one of the values is the same as another of the values,
     it does not count towards the sum.


        loneSum(1, 2, 3) → 6
        loneSum(3, 2, 3) → 2
        loneSum(3, 3, 3) → 0





7. public int luckySum(int a, int b, int c)

    Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if one of the values is 13 
    then it does not count towards the sum and values to its right do not count. 
    So for example, if b is 13, then both b and c do not count.


        luckySum(1, 2, 3) → 6
        luckySum(1, 2, 13) → 3
        luckySum(1, 13, 3) → 1
