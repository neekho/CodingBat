1 public String doubleChar(String str) ->

    Given a string, return a string where for every char in the original, there are two chars.


        doubleChar("The") → "TThhee"
        doubleChar("AAbb") → "AAAAbbbb"
        doubleChar("Hi-There") → "HHii--TThheerree"




2 public int countCode(String str) ->

    Return the number of times that the string "code" appears anywhere in the given string, 
    except we'll accept any letter for the 'd', so "cope" and "cooe" count.


        countCode("aaacodebbb") → 1
        countCode("codexxcode") → 2
        countCode("cozexxcope") → 2


3. public boolean bobThere(String str) ->
    
    Return true if the given string contains a "bob" string, but where the middle 'o' char can be any char.

        bobThere("abcbob") → true
        bobThere("b9b") → true
        bobThere("bac") → false



4. public String repeatEnd(String str, int n) ->

    Given a string and an int n, return a string made of n repetitions of the last n characters of the string. 
    You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string, inclusive.

        repeatEnd("Hello", 3) → "llollollo"
        repeatEnd("Hello", 2) → "lolo"
        repeatEnd("Hello", 1) → "o"


5. 

6.


7. public String starOut(String str)

    Return a version of the given string, where for every star (*) in the string the star and the chars immediately to its left and right are gone. 
    So "ab*cd" yields "ad" and "ab**cd" also yields "ad".

        starOut("ab*cd") → "ad"
        starOut("ab**cd") → "ad"
        starOut("sm*eilly") → "silly"



8. public int countHi(String str) -> 
    Return the number of times that the string "hi" appears anywhere in the given string.

        countHi("abc hi ho") → 1
        countHi("ABChi hi") → 2
        countHi("hihi") → 2
